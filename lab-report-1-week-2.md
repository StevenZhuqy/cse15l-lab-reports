* First Step (Installing VScode): 
Go to [VScode Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download#) website to download and install the Visual Studio Code on your computer. This is an IDE where you can write code and run commands in its terminal, which is needed for doing remote control. You will see a screen as below once you've installed and opened VScode on your computer. (Make sure to download the version that best fits your computer!)
